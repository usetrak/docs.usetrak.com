### A note about updates to this documentation

The documentation may undergo continuous changes since the project is under active development.
There isn't yet an automatic documentation creation pipelineâ€”for now.
Any help is appreciated!

This page will be a moment behind what you can find in the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/lcfd/trak#readme).

## Installation

### Pypi

[On Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/trakcli/) you can find the package under the `trakcli` name.

You can install it with pip:

```bash
pip install trakcli
```

or with pipx:

```bash
pipx install trakcli
```

### Brew

TBA

### Nix

`nix run github:lcfd/trak`

### Try the code locally

If you want to try the latest unpublished changes you can install locally the code in the repository by using `Poetry` and `pipx`.

Run `poetry build` and then

```bash
# x.x.x = The version you have used to do the build.
pipx install ./dist/trakcli-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl
```

to install `trak` using the wheel file.

## Usage

The package has the useful `--help` command that will explain all the commands.

The CLI will guide you anyway through what you should and must do with messages with specific messages.

### Basic commands

To start using you can use those basic commands.
They will create a project, run a session, get how is going, stop the session.

```bash
# Create a project
trak create project <project-id>

# Start a session for a project
trak start <project-id>

# Check how the session is going on
trak status

# Stop the session
trak stop
```

Start tracking a billable project:

`trak start pasta -b`

Start tracking a project on a specific category/topic:

`trak start pasta -c rigatoni`

### But there is a lot more than that

All the commands are described in the help command:

`trak --help`

## Starship

There is a dedicated command that ouputs clean strings for tools like Starship:

`trak status -s` or `trak status --starship`

To see the status in your terminal line open `$HOME/.config/starship.toml`
and put this snippet inside of it:

```bash
[custom.trak]
command = """ trak status -s """
when = "trak status"
shell = "sh"
```
